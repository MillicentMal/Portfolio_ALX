#This is the Portfolio Project for the ALX SE Program - Foundations Path


<strong>Missing Features<strong>
1. UBWIZA is a <strong>CRUD<strong> app, but because it was deployed with sqlite on Heroku, the database malfunctions. Hence these features 
do not run as expected on the deployed app. 
<strong>The current plan is to collaborate with someone and migrate the project to a Postgresql database.<strong>

<strong>RESPONSIVENESS<strong>
The app is not responsive at all and I have already started implementing some responsiveness and this can be found on the main branch. 
Once complete, a pull request and merge will be carried out. 

<strong>My UX design skills are not great hence the UI is not at its best. Because I built this project alone, I will be reaching out to colleagues who wish to, to help create a better design that I can implement using CSS, AND Javascript. 
<strong>

<strong>Email Authentication<strong>
This has not been added either. 
<strong>Flask-Admin<strong>
I am working on implementing a Flask Admin page that will allow me to view processes from the web as well.  

TEAM
Millicent Malinga
I am working on this project alone although I will receive guidance from my technical mentor. 
TECHNOLOGIES
HTML
CSS
Javascript
For Javascript there exists the alternative, Java. “Java is to Javascript as Ham is to Hamster. (Rose, 2019)”
I find Javascript easier to learn and understand as I have already started learning it, and applying it to web development exercises. Javascript is more popular than Java in the Software development industry meaning there will be higher chances of having other developers collaborate on my project than if I used JAVA. 
Due to its similarity to C( a language I have the hardest time understanding), I chose to learn Javascript instead.
MySQL
SQLAlchemy/Python
Java is dynamic and is also very popular for backend. I chose Python though because within my community, Python is the go-to language hence it would be easier to get assistance/ collaborations. 
Python syntax is also very user-friendly, and less bulky compared to Java. 
Flask
RESTful API
JQuery

CHALLENGE
Due to the poor business processes in beauty parlors in Kigali e.g. hairdressers taking over 5 hours to do one head and making a minimum income of about $5 a day each, lack of an open pricing system, and the lack of diverse products, beauty, and hair care service providers, overcharge international students as they are not aware of the regular prices. This has been happening to students at ALU since the campus was established in 2017. Every international student has reported having at least been overcharged or received a subpar service at the salons or had a fallout with a service provider. 

SOLUTION
Ubiza aims to provide an on-demand  beauty and haircare marketplace that utilizes technology to connect highly skilled beauty specialists, and retailers of beauty products, to students in Kigali for the delivery of quality beauty and hair care services and products. 

PROBLEMS UBIZA WILL SOLVE
 hair and beauty specialists
Ubiza will be a directory for all/most service providers in the beauty industry. Specialists will be expected to provide their complete services and prices, skills, contacts, and location. This will ensure that students who have access to Ubiza will be able to choose a specialist according to what services they require that day. 
There will also be a section for specialists to state whether or not they provide home visits. 
Products
Since Ubiza is a marketplace, all registered retailers will be expected to provide a list of all their products and how much they cost. Delivery fees should also be added as well as contact details and location
skills
Ubiza will organize training sessions on running a business more efficiently and partner with stakeholders such as Access Bank. Mastercard Foundation to deliver skills training to registered self-employed or business owners of beauty and hair care businesses. 


WHAT UBIZA WILL NOT SOLVE
Poor services provided
Ubiza can not guarantee that service providers registered on the site can do all they claim to be able to do. This could be mitigated by expanding the pieces of training to involve technical skills training.
Lack of diverse products
The lack of availability of products from other countries could be due to the high tax on imports in Rwanda. As a result, Ubiza can not guarantee that students will be able to access more diverse products in the marketplace. 
By adding links to online platforms such as Kikuu that sell hair products, this could be dealt with. 
Communication barriers between clients and service providers
Another source of problems is that very few international students can speak Kinyarwanda, and very few service providers can speak English. Ubiza has not solved this communication barrier yet. 



Infrastructure
I will use the Feature branching and manual review and merge strategies. 
For deployment, the Recreate strategy will be used.
